# Cybersecurity Use Cases

Blackbox Data Pro provides tamper‑evident evidence for data pipelines and can
be used as part of a broader security posture.

## Use Cases
- **Forensic integrity:** Detect tampering via hash‑chain verification.
- **Incident response:** Export evidence bundles for audit and root‑cause review.
- **Data poisoning defense:** Spot unexpected churn, schema drift, or anomalous changes.
- **Compliance workflows:** Support SOC2/ISO evidence collection and retention.

## Why It Matters
Data pipelines are part of the attack surface. A verifiable audit trail reduces
time to investigate and increases confidence in outputs.
